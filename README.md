# ticTacToe


## Abstract:
- Here is a tic-tac-toe game coded in vanilla js, html and css. This game is not created in the DOM, but rather using a data model and reflecting the data model to display in the DOM. This game will work as a normal tic tac toe game with winners, draws, and counts.

## Context:
- We were given approximately a week to work on this project. I would estimate that this project took around 40 hours to complete. I am currently in Mod 1 week 6.

## Learning Goals:
- Learning goals for this project were to create a data model and play the game solely based on the data model. Then, simply reflect the data model in our DOM.

## Tech Used:
- I worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub workflow.

## Wins + Challenges:

## Wins:
- Getting the game to be fully functional, bug free
- Not getting the solutions from others, only rubber ducking

## Challenges:
- Fixing all of the bugs to get the game working properly
- Creating the data model to be functional
- Not adding extra features or better styling, shouldve had better time management for this
